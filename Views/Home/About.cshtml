                    <p>Hari Om Namo Narayanaya Namaha. Our Sri Adisesha Thiruthalam, Kaliyuga Ranganathar Temple, is a holy place located in Nagalur village under Athani in the Erode district's Anthiyur division. In 2008, on a piece of farmland I purchased, the supreme power Sri Mahashakti Ambikai appeared to me in the form of a Linga and, after leaving from Tirupati, manifested herself to descend into the well located in this farmland. Following that, a divine event occurred in my own body as well. She declared, 'I have ingested the five elements at the mouth and conceived them in the stomach, and I stand here.' Till now, all 14 kumbhabhishekams have been performed only on Amavasya (new moon) days, without altering the date or consulting the Panchangam (Hindu calendar/almanac). When Sri Mahashakti Ambikai appeared to me, she said that the Kaliyugam will end in 2088. She also declared that a 12-tier Rajagopuram (temple tower) would rise at this place. Lord Perumal himself will build his own temple here. When Pralaya (cosmic dissolution) occurs, Bhagavan himself will incarnate, ingest the five elements at the mouth and conceive them in the stomach, and at the end of the Pralaya, He will expel them from His mouth.</p>
